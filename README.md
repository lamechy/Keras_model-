## About

In this repository, I created a tf.keras.Sequential model and trained it on a random generated data set. Ultimately, the goal of this model is to tell us whether or not a patient will experience side effects solely based on the patient's age.

## Prerequisite
Before you get to work on this project, it's recommended that you have a relevant environment.
In this case, I used Anaconda to set up the environment.(*Consider installing Anaconda  if you haven't had it installed already*)
Secondly, Jupyter Notebook or Colab Notebook are just great if used. However, you can still use an IDE of your choice.

### Set-Up and Pre-installation Guide
With Anaconda installed we'll need to set up our environment in our desired directory on the local machine using the command below on the terminal or cmd (*This environment will have tensorflow for CPU intalled in it*):

- `conda create -n <environment name> tensorflow`

Once created, activate it using:

- `conda activate <environment name>`

With the conda environment activated, install this libraries and packages  using the  commands below.
- `conda install numpy`
- `conda install scikit-learn`
 

At  this point we can serve to the our Jupyter Notebook and and get our hands at work
Serving the Jupyter notebook from the terminal is quite easy if you have it installed; just run thi command:
- `jupyter-notebook`
